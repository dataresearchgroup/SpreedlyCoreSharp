### Introduction

SpreedlyCoreSharp is a C# API client for the payment service Spreedly.

Spreedly decided to drop the name "Core" and this project should perhaps be renamed SpreedlySharp.

### How to install

The easiest way to get SpreedlyCoreSharp is to install it via NuGet:

```
Install-Package SpreedlyCoreSharp
```

[Package page](http://www.nuget.org/packages/SpreedlyCoreSharp/)

### Demos

Included is a full web sample in c# and NancyFX (lightweight C# web framework) that shows you how to build a payment form with or without 3D Secure.

Currently you have to edit the "AppSettings.config" with your environment key and other keys. Eventually this could be automated.
